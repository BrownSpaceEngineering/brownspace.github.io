                    an undergraduate student group at Brown University's School of Engineering.
                    EQUiSat's mission was to test a battery technology that had never flown in space which powered an beacon that was designed to be visible from Earth.

                    will be to test the performance of next-generation perovskite solar cells in the harsh orbital environment.
                    Perovskites are emerging as a low-cost challenger to silicon for making highly efficient solar cells. </div>

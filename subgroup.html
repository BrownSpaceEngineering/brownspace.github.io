                    Flight Software (FSW) is tasked with hardware-software integration, merging PVDX’s complex array of sensors and actuators into a central operating system that manages the transfer of information between the satellite and the ground station.

                        We are actively developing firmware for a magnetometer, 9-axis motion tracker, radio, OLED display, camera, and random-access-memory using embedded C. To complement this firmware, we are designing a custom data-storage system which handles sensor readings over both I2C and SPI serial communication protocols. Fault-tolerance is core to FSW, and our members are implementing a watchdog system that constantly monitors the health of tasks running within our OS, as well as a cosmic-ray bit-flip simulator that randomly mutates memory to emulate the volatile conditions of low-earth orbit. To further ensure robustness of our design, we are porting a unit-test library over to our embedded architecture. Moving forward, our subgroup will also be incorporating attitude determination and control algorithms into the OS – and creating radiation-safe functions to read/write data to three units of duplicated memory.

                    Attitude Determination & Control Systems (ADCS) is responsible for identifying and maintaining the proper orientation of PVDX as it orbits in space. By collecting data from onboard sensors such as magnetometers and combining them with knowledge of previous states,

                    <span id="more3" style="display: none;">
                    ADCS algorithms are designed to dynamically adjust the orientation of the satellite to point at the ground station in Providence, RI, enabling fast data transmission via the S band antenna. Upon launch, PVDX will have unknown initial velocities. To stabilize the satellite in orbit, we have implemented the B-dot algorithm, which utilizes change in magnetometer readings to reduce angular velocities to near-zero. Once this stage is complete, the satellite will enter 'pointing mode'. ADCS is currently designing the algorithm to determine satellite orientation from magnetometer measurements only.
